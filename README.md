# Dashboard: dblp Datase
## Elements
The file `docs/elements.json` provides an overview of the elements per category of the dataset.

## Database
The `dblp.xml` file has been converted to a SQL database using a self made script. The different Tables of the Database can bee seen under `docs/Database.md`.

The file has been converted using `app/read_test.py`. Do not run this script, as it takes multiple hours to finish inserting all the tables into the database.

## Version control with git
Chabges are versioned with git and each new feature is introduced through a github pull request.
